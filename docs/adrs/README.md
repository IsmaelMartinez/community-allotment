# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant technical decisions made in the Community Allotment application.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help new team members understand why things are the way they are.

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
- **Decision**: What did we decide to do?
- **Consequences**: What are the results of this decision?
