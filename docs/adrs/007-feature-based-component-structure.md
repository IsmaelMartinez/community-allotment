# ADR 007: Feature-Based Component Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-01 (retrospective)

## Context

As the application grew with multiple features (announcements, calendar, AI advisor, garden planner), we needed a component organization strategy that:
- Keeps related components together
- Scales as features are added
- Makes dependencies clear
- Supports code splitting

## Decision

Use a **feature-based component structure** where components are grouped by the feature they belong to.

### Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.tsx              # Shared global component
│   └── garden-planner/             # Feature-specific folder
│       ├── PlanManager.tsx
│       ├── VegetableSelector.tsx
│       ├── PlotManager.tsx
│       ├── PlotView.tsx
│       ├── ListView.tsx
│       ├── CalendarView.tsx
│       ├── ExportImport.tsx
│       └── ViewSwitcher.tsx
├── app/
│   ├── garden-planner/
│   │   └── page.tsx               # Assembles feature components
│   ├── companion-planting/
│   │   └── page.tsx               # Self-contained page
│   └── composting/
│       └── page.tsx               # Self-contained page
```

### Two Patterns Observed

#### 1. Complex Features → Separate Components Folder

**Garden Planner** has many interactive components, so they're organized in `components/garden-planner/`:

```typescript
// src/app/garden-planner/page.tsx
import PlanManager from '@/components/garden-planner/PlanManager'
import VegetableSelector from '@/components/garden-planner/VegetableSelector'
import ListView from '@/components/garden-planner/ListView'
import PlotView from '@/components/garden-planner/PlotView'
import CalendarView from '@/components/garden-planner/CalendarView'
```

#### 2. Simple Features → Self-Contained Pages

**Companion Planting** and **Composting** are information-heavy with minimal interaction, so everything is in the page file:

```typescript
// src/app/companion-planting/page.tsx
const companionPlantingPairs = [ /* data */ ]
const companionPlantingPrinciples = [ /* data */ ]
const seasonalTips = [ /* data */ ]

export default function CompanionPlantingPage() {
  return ( /* UI using inline data */ )
}
```

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `page.tsx` | State management, data orchestration, layout |
| Feature components | Specific UI + behavior, receive props from page |
| `Navigation.tsx` | App-wide navigation, used in layout.tsx |

### Data Flow Pattern

```
page.tsx (state holder)
    │
    ├── loads data (localStorage/API)
    ├── manages state (useState)
    ├── defines handlers (onAdd, onDelete, etc.)
    │
    └── passes to components as props
        ├── PlanManager (onCreatePlan, onDeletePlan)
        ├── VegetableSelector (onAddVegetable)
        ├── ListView (vegetables, onUpdateVegetable)
        └── PlotView (plots, onAssignVegetable)
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear ownership** - Know where to find garden planner code
- **Encapsulation** - Feature changes don't affect others
- **Scalable** - Easy to add new features
- **Code splitting** - Next.js can lazy-load feature components
- **Testable** - Components can be tested in isolation

### Negative
- **Inconsistency** - Some features have components, others don't
- **No shared UI library** - Buttons, cards, etc. are not abstracted
- **Prop drilling** - Page passes many props to components

### When to Extract Components

Current guidelines:
1. **Extract** when component is used in multiple places
2. **Extract** when page file exceeds ~300 lines
3. **Extract** when component has its own state/logic
4. **Keep inline** for static display content

### Future Considerations

- Create shared `components/ui/` for common elements (Button, Card, Modal)
- Consider component library (shadcn/ui) for consistency
- Add barrel exports (`components/garden-planner/index.ts`)
