# ADR 004: File-Based Storage Without Database

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-01 (retrospective)

## Context

When starting the project, we needed to decide on data storage. Options considered:
1. Traditional database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. NoSQL database (MongoDB, Firebase)
3. File-based storage (JSON files)
4. Cloud storage services (Supabase, PlanetScale)

Constraints:
- Minimize operational complexity
- Enable quick deployment without database provisioning
- Keep hosting costs low or free
- Support offline development
- No user authentication required initially

## Decision

Use **file-based JSON storage** for server-side data and **localStorage** for client-side data, avoiding any database dependency.

### Server-Side Data (Announcements)

```
data/
├── announcements.json           # Production data
└── announcements-demo-backup.json  # Backup/demo data
```

```typescript
// Read/write operations
import { promises as fs } from 'fs'
import path from 'path'

const dataFile = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'announcements.json')
const data = await fs.readFile(dataFile, 'utf-8')
await fs.writeFile(dataFile, JSON.stringify(announcements, null, 2))
```

### Client-Side Data (Garden Planner)

```typescript
// localStorage for persistence
const STORAGE_KEY = 'garden-planner-data'
localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(data))
const stored = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY)
```

### Data Characteristics

| Data Type | Storage | Shared | Persistent | Editable By |
|-----------|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Announcements | JSON file | Yes | Yes | Admin |
| Garden Plans | localStorage | No | Yes | User |
| AI Chat | Memory | No | Session | User |
| API Tokens | sessionStorage | No | Session | User |

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure** - No database to provision, maintain, or pay for
- **Simple deployment** - Works on any Node.js host (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- **Version control** - JSON files can be committed to git
- **Offline development** - No database connection required
- **Fast reads** - File system is very fast for small datasets
- **Easy debugging** - Data is human-readable JSON

### Negative
- **Not scalable** - File I/O doesn't scale for high traffic
- **No concurrent writes** - Risk of data corruption with simultaneous edits
- **No querying** - Can't do complex queries like SQL
- **No relationships** - Manual handling of data relationships
- **Size limits** - Large datasets would slow down reads
- **No ACID guarantees** - Potential data loss on crashes

### Mitigations

1. **Announcements are admin-only** - Limited concurrent write risk
2. **Garden plans are user-local** - No server-side conflicts
3. **Small dataset expected** - Community allotment, not enterprise scale
4. **Export/Import** - Users can backup their data

### When to Reconsider

This decision should be revisited if:
- User accounts are added (need user database)
- Multiple admins edit simultaneously (need locking/transactions)
- Data grows beyond 100KB (need proper database)
- Real-time features needed (need WebSockets + database)
- Analytics/reporting required (need queryable database)
