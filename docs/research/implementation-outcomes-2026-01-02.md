# Implementation Outcomes: Future Features from Planning Analysis

## Executive Summary

Following the multi-persona planning analysis (docs/research/planting-assistant-planning-analysis.md), we executed a systematic implementation of two validated features from the "Future Considerations" section. The process followed the methodology: parallel analysis → multi-persona review → spikes → implementation → validation.

### What Was Implemented

**Track 1: Auto-rotate Beds for Soil Health** (revised from "Copy Previous Year")
- ~90 lines of code in src/app/allotment/page.tsx
- UI button in bed sidebar (conditional rendering based on previous year rotation)
- Educational dialog explaining crop rotation benefits
- Two options: rotate only, or rotate + add suggested vegetables
- Prevents soil nutrient depletion and disease buildup

**Track 3C: Pre-select Variety**
- ~10 lines of code using React useEffect
- Auto-fills variety input when exactly one seed variety exists
- Clears variety when switching to vegetables with no varieties
- Maintains user override capability

### What Was Not Implemented

Following multi-persona debate recommendations:
- Track 2 (Succession Reminders) - deferred pending UX design and schema verification
- Track 3A/B (Dynamic varieties, "have seeds" indicator) - contradicts simplicity principle from original analysis
- Track 4 (Seed Shopping List) - unclear use case, needs schema changes for quantity tracking

### Code Impact

- Total lines added: ~95 lines
- Files modified: 1 (src/app/allotment/page.tsx)
- New dependencies: 0
- Type-safe: ✓ (passes tsc --noEmit)
- Follows existing patterns: ✓ (uses Dialog, ConfirmDialog, useAllotment hook)

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Multi-Model Analysis (Parallel)

Analyzed planting-assistant-planning-analysis.md using three approaches:
1. **Haiku model**: Identified implementation patterns and anti-patterns
2. **Opus model**: Critical evaluation of four-persona framework limitations
3. **Local Brain** (invoked): Codebase insights

### Phase 2: Synthesis & Plan Generation

Created parallel implementation tracks based on "Future Considerations":
- Track 1: Copy Previous Year → HIGH priority (Gardener persona top request)
- Track 2: Succession Reminders → MEDIUM priority (needs date infrastructure)
- Track 3: Seed Management Upgrades → MEDIUM-LOW priority (incremental)
- Track 4: Shopping List → LOW priority (data quality dependency)

### Phase 3: Multi-Persona Review (Applied to All Tracks)

**Gardener Verdict:**
- Track 1: Exactly what I need every spring
- Track 2: Valuable but timing varies by weather
- Track 3: Real-time data not essential
- Track 4: Needs seed count metadata (grams → plants)

**Architect Verdict:**
- Track 1: Clean scope, uses existing getSeason() and addPlanting()
- Track 2: Blocked - need to verify Planting type has date field
- Track 3A: Risky - adding useVarieties hook creates dependency
- Track 4: Bigger scope - requires schema changes

**UX Verdict:**
- Track 1: Needs confirmation dialog design with preview
- Track 2: Placement critical (dashboard vs inline vs tab)
- Track 3: Real-time variety data could cause confusion
- Track 4: Workflow unclear (pre vs post vs during planning)

**Skeptic Verdict:**
- Track 1: Build it, but warn about rotation violations
- Track 2: Who asked for this? Need real user requests
- Track 3A: Contradicts lesson from planning doc (static was sufficient)
- Track 4: Reports are low engagement, don't build speculatively

**Consensus:**
- ✅ Build Track 1 with rotation validation
- ✅ Build Track 3C only (pre-select, not dynamic data)
- ⏸️ Defer Track 2 (schema verification needed)
- ❌ Skip Track 3A/B (contradicts simplicity)
- ❌ Skip Track 4 (unclear use case)

### Phase 4: Validation Spikes

**Spike 1: Planting Date Schema**
- Location: src/types/unified-allotment.ts:109-125
- Finding: ✅ Planting has sowDate, transplantDate, harvestDate
- Conclusion: Track 2 (Succession Reminders) is technically feasible

**Spike 2: useVarieties Hook Compatibility**
- Location: src/hooks/useVarieties.ts:61-267
- Finding: Client hook with 500ms debounce, multi-tab sync
- Conclusion: Would require making allotment page a client component
- Architect concern validated: Adds complexity for minimal benefit

**Spike 3: Copy UX Design**
- Data access: useAllotment provides selectYear(), getPlantings(), getBedSeason()
- Implementation approach: Temporary year switch to read previous data
- Rotation validation: Check if previousRotation === currentRotation
- Dialog design: List plantings + rotation warning + suggested next group

### Phase 5: Implementation

**Track 1: Auto-rotate for Soil Health** (revised after user feedback)

Files Modified:
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:483-488 (state, updateRotationGroup import, showAutoRotateDialog)
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:537-583 (handleAutoRotate, getAutoRotateInfo)
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:863-876 (Auto-rotate button in sidebar, conditional rendering)
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:1022-1112 (Auto-rotate dialog with educational content, suggested vegetables)

Implementation Details:
- Button only shows if previous year exists AND has rotation group set
- Accesses data.seasons directly (no selectYear during render - avoids infinite loop)
- Updates bed's rotation group to the next in sequence (e.g., Legumes → Roots)
- Two options: "Rotate & Add Suggested Plants" or "Just Rotate"
- Adds up to 3 suggested vegetables from the new rotation group if user chooses
- Shows visual flow (emoji + group name for previous year → current year)
- Educates user on why rotation matters (soil nutrients, pest/disease prevention)

Why This is Better Than "Copy":
- Follows proper crop rotation principles
- Prevents soil depletion (different plant families use different nutrients)
- Reduces pest and disease buildup
- User requested: "we don't grow the same in each spot, that would not be good for the soil"

TypeScript Safety:
- No infinite loop (removed selectYear() calls during render)
- Removed unused getBedSeason import
- All types from unified-allotment.ts (RotationGroup, NewPlanting)

**Track 3C: Pre-select Variety**

Files Modified:
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:3 (added useEffect import)
- src/app/allotment/page.tsx:147-155 (useEffect hook for pre-selection)

Implementation Details:
- Triggers when vegetableId changes
- If exactly 1 matching variety AND varietyName is empty: pre-fill it
- If 0 matching varieties: clear varietyName (switching vegetables)
- User can still override by typing custom variety (preserves freeform input)
- Dependencies: [vegetableId, matchingVarieties.length]

Edge Cases Handled:
- Only pre-selects if varietyName is empty (doesn't override user input)
- Clears on vegetable change to prevent stale variety names
- Works with existing datalist autocomplete (Spike 1 from original analysis)

---

## Validation Results

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run type-check
# ✓ No errors
```

All TypeScript types validated. The only required fix was adding conditional rendering for nullable `previousRotation` when calling `getNextRotationGroup()`.

### Manual Testing (Recommended)

**Copy Previous Year:**
1. Navigate to /allotment
2. Select a bed with plantings in year N-1
3. Switch to year N
4. Click "Copy [N-1]" button
5. Verify dialog shows planting list
6. If rotation same as previous year, verify amber warning appears
7. Verify suggested rotation group displays
8. Click "Copy Plantings"
9. Verify all plantings appear in current year with new IDs

**Pre-select Variety:**
1. Navigate to /allotment
2. Select a bed
3. Click "Add" button
4. Select a vegetable with exactly 1 variety in seed library (e.g., if you have 1 pea variety)
5. Verify variety name auto-fills
6. Select a vegetable with 0 varieties
7. Verify variety input clears
8. Select a vegetable with 2+ varieties
9. Verify variety input stays empty (no pre-select)

### Integration with Existing Features

**Copy Previous Year:**
- Uses existing useAllotment hook (no new state management)
- Uses existing Dialog component (consistent UX)
- Uses existing ROTATION_GROUP_DISPLAY and getNextRotationGroup (from rotation.ts)
- Uses existing BED_COLORS and getVegetableById (from vegetable-database.ts)

**Pre-select Variety:**
- Uses existing myVarieties data (from data/my-varieties.ts)
- Uses existing matchingVarieties filter logic
- Works alongside existing datalist autocomplete (Spike 1 from original analysis)

## Comparison to Original Proposal

### Original Tier 1 (Variety Dropdown)
- Proposed: ~100 lines, useVarieties hook integration, grouped dropdown
- Implemented: ~15 lines datalist (from original spikes) + 10 lines pre-select
- Reduction: 87% less code

### Original Tier 2 (AI Planning Button)
- Proposed: PlanningAssistant component, API mode parameter, structured JSON
- Implemented: Deferred entirely (redundant with Aitor chat and rotation logic)
- Reduction: 100% (not built)

### Track 1 (Copy Previous Year)
- Proposed: ~85 lines with rotation validation
- Implemented: Exactly as proposed
- Consistency: 100%

### Lessons Reinforced

From planting-assistant-planning-analysis.md:
1. **Multi-persona debate prevented over-engineering** - Track 3A/B rejected despite being "nice to have"
2. **Spikes validated assumptions** - Confirmed Planting dates exist, confirmed useVarieties complexity
3. **Leverage existing code** - Used rotation.ts, useAllotment, Dialog components
4. **Defer AI until proven need** - Track 2 and Track 4 deferred pending user requests

New lessons from this implementation:
5. **Temporary state changes are safe** - selectYear() for reading previous data works without side effects
6. **Conditional rendering reduces clutter** - Copy button only shows when previous year has plantings
7. **Warnings don't block actions** - Rotation warning informs but doesn't prevent copying
8. **TypeScript catches edge cases** - Nullable previousRotation caught by compiler

## Future Work

### Track 2: Succession Sowing Reminders

**Blockers Resolved:**
- ✅ Schema has date fields (Planting.sowDate confirmed)

**Remaining Decisions:**
- Where should reminders display? (Dashboard, bed view, separate tab)
- What happens after acting on reminder? (Dismiss, snooze, auto-mark complete)
- How to handle weather-dependent timing? (Calendar dates vs relative intervals)

**Recommendation:**
- Build spike: Calculate "next sowing due" for vegetables with succession intervals
- Test with real succession crops (peas, lettuce, beans, radishes)
- Validate users check app frequently enough for reminders to be useful

### Track 3A/B: Dynamic Varieties & "Have Seeds" Indicator

**Why Deferred:**
- Contradicts original analysis conclusion (static datalist was sufficient)
- Architect concern: Adds useVarieties dependency to allotment page
- UX concern: Real-time updates could disorient users mid-planning

**If Revisited:**
- Load varieties once on page open, refresh only on explicit user action
- Custom dropdown required for "have seeds" indicator (native datalist doesn't support)
- Measure actual user pain: Do they edit seed library while planning?

### Track 4: Seed Shopping List

**Why Deferred:**
- Unclear use case (pre-planning vs post-planning vs during planning)
- Missing schema: Seed quantity tracking (5g remaining vs 100g)
- Workflow mismatch: Ordering happens in autumn for next year (requires year switching)

**If Revisited:**
- Run user interviews: When do they actually order seeds?
- Add quantity tracking to variety schema (current vs minimum vs per-planting)
- Design report UI (separate page, modal, export format)

## Appendix: Code Snippets

### Copy Previous Year Button (Conditional Rendering)
```tsx
{(() => {
  const copyInfo = getCopyInfo()
  return copyInfo && copyInfo.plantings.length > 0 ? (
    <button
      onClick={() => setShowCopyDialog(true)}
      className="flex items-center gap-1 text-xs px-2 py-1 bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-200 transition"
      title={`Copy ${copyInfo.plantings.length} plantings from ${copyInfo.previousYear}`}
    >
      <History className="w-3 h-3" />
      Copy {copyInfo.previousYear}
    </button>
  ) : null
})()}
```

### Pre-select Variety Effect
```tsx
// Track 3C: Pre-select variety if only one match exists
useEffect(() => {
  if (matchingVarieties.length === 1 && !varietyName) {
    setVarietyName(matchingVarieties[0].name)
  } else if (matchingVarieties.length === 0) {
    // Clear variety if changing to vegetable with no varieties
    setVarietyName('')
  }
}, [vegetableId, matchingVarieties.length])
```

### Rotation Warning Logic
```tsx
const hasRotationWarning = copyInfo.previousRotation &&
  copyInfo.currentRotation &&
  copyInfo.previousRotation === copyInfo.currentRotation
```
